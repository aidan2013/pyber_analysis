# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to help PyBer find the relationship between urban, suburban, and rural city types and drivers and riders. This analysis is also to show the relationship between the types of city and the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers. This will help imporve access to PyBer services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

The ride-sharing data summary includes total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
By reviewing this summary, we can break down the data and see that the rural city types are underserved and less affordable. 

We can see that the total drivers significantly decreases when we go from Urban to Suburban and Rural city types. 
Urban cities have more than 30 times more drivers available compared to rural cities.

We can also see that there is a negative relationship between the average fare per ride and number of rides per city when comparing the different city types. 
The more drivers and rides there are in the city, the lower the average fare is per ride. 

Something to note is in urban cities, there are more drivers than there are rides. In suburban and rural cites, there are more rides than there are drivers.

When comparing the percentage of total rides, drivers and fares, we can see that urban and suburban cities together make up more than 90%. Urban and suburban citites bring in most of the revenue.

# Summary:

In conclusion, the recommendations for adressing disparities in affordability and availability among city types are as follows:

- Increase the number of drivers in rural areas and suburban areas by providing incentives to employ more drivers within those areas that are under served. 
- Lower the cost for rural areas in order to bring in more business to those areas and not deter the customer basis from tilizing the service due to the cost. 
- Although urban cities make up the most rides compared to suburban and rural cities, we can see that they have an excess of drivers. Decreasing the amount of drivers in urban cities would also balance out the fare costs.
